## How to Write an Entry

Copy this template and fill in all fields. Never leave a field blank — use "None"
if genuinely nothing to report.

```
### STORY-XXX — [Title]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Sprint:** N | **Phase:** A or B | **Repo:** ravenbase-api or ravenbase-web
**Quality gate:** ✅ clean  OR  ⚠️ passed with warnings  OR  ❌ failed (describe fix)
**Commit:** `xxxxxxxx`  ← first 8 chars of git commit hash

**What was built:**
1–3 sentences. What exists now that did not exist before.

**Key decisions:**
Bullet points. Any non-obvious architectural choice made during this story and the
reason behind it. These are the entries most valuable to future agents and to you
when debugging months later. If you followed the story spec exactly with no
deviations, write "Implemented per spec — no deviations."

**Gotchas:**
Bullet points. Non-obvious behaviors, library quirks, environment surprises,
or things that took longer than expected. If none, write "None."

**Tech debt noted:**
Bullet points. Anything deferred, implemented suboptimally, or that should be
revisited in a later story. If none, write "None."
```

## Sprint 1 — Foundation

> Backend scaffolding: repos, Docker, databases, ARQ worker, health endpoint.
> Sprints 1 covers STORY-001 and STORY-002.

### STORY-001 — API and Web Repo Scaffolding
**Date:** 2026-03-25 | **Sprint:** 1 | **Phase:** A | **Repo:** ravenbase-api + ravenbase-web
**Quality gate:** ✅ clean
**Commit:** `4fee9e9`

**What was built:**
Scaffolded both ravenbase-api and ravenbase-web from scratch. API: FastAPI app with `/health` endpoint, full Python package structure, pyproject.toml + uv.lock, Makefile, three Docker Compose configs, ARQ worker stub, Alembic config, and test fixtures. Web: Next.js 15 App Router with Tailwind v4 design tokens, three Google fonts, brand components (RavenbaseLogo 5 sizes + RavenbaseLockup), shadcn/ui Button, error pages, and admin/dashboard route groups.

**Key decisions:**
- CORS set to localhost:3000 for dev and ravenbase.app for prod, respecting deployment environments
- Used lifespan context manager pattern (FastAPI 0.93+) for ARQ pool and database lifecycle
- structlog configured with environment branching: ConsoleRenderer in dev, JSONRenderer in prod
- Alembic initialized in autogenerate mode for schema migrations

**Gotchas:**
- uv.lock must be committed to git (not .gitignore'd) to ensure reproducible dependency resolution
- FastAPI lifespan pattern requires Python 3.10+ async context manager syntax
- CORS middleware order matters; must be applied before route registration

**Tech debt noted:**
None.

### STORY-002 — PostgreSQL Schema + Alembic Migrations
**Date:** 2026-03-25 | **Sprint:** 1 | **Phase:** A | **Repo:** ravenbase-api
**Quality gate:** ✅ clean
**Commit:** `39fa3c9`

**What was built:**
All 8 SQLModel table classes (`User`, `SystemProfile`, `Source`, `SourceAuthorityWeight`, `Conflict`, `MetaDocument`, `CreditTransaction`, `JobStatus`) with correct field types, defaults, indexes, and foreign keys. Alembic autogenerate migration created and applied (`234dbe10`). Two composite indexes added for query performance: `idx_sources_user_ingested` and `idx_conflicts_user_status_created`. 8 unit tests + 3 integration tests all passing.

**Key decisions:**
- Used async Alembic pattern (`asyncio.run` + `async_engine_from_config` + `connection.run_sync`) because `DATABASE_URL` uses `+asyncpg` driver; sync pattern (psycopg2) is not installed.
- Source composite index uses `ingested_at` (not `created_at`) — Source model has no `created_at` field; plan had a naming mismatch.
- `MetaDocument` uses PostgreSQL-specific `JSONB` + `ARRAY(String)` column types via `sa_column=Column(...)` — unit tests validate Python-level instantiation only, not DB types.
- `CreditTransaction.id` is an int (BIGSERIAL) not UUID — credit ledger uses sequential integer PKs for ordering guarantees.
- All `__tablename__` assignments suppressed with `# type: ignore[assignment]` — known pyright false positive with SQLModel.
- All `Optional[X]` rewritten to `X | None` (ruff UP045) for Python 3.10+ compatibility.

**Gotchas:**
- `asyncpg` and `greenlet` were missing from `pyproject.toml` (STORY-001 gap) — had to add both before `alembic upgrade head` would work.
- `alembic/script.py.mako` was missing (STORY-001 gap) — had to copy from `.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/alembic/templates/async/script.py.mako`.
- `alembic.ini` is inside `alembic/` directory, not project root — must use `uv run alembic -c alembic/alembic.ini ...`.
- `.envs/.env.dev` points to Supabase production DB; local Docker uses `ravenbase:ravenbase@localhost:5432/ravenbase` — override via `DATABASE_URL=...` env var prefix when running alembic locally.
- Auto-generated migration file referenced `sqlmodel.sql.sqltypes.AutoString` without importing `sqlmodel` — caused `NameError` at upgrade time; fixed by adding `import sqlmodel  # noqa: F401`.
- Docker postgres credentials are `ravenbase/ravenbase` (from `docker-compose.yml POSTGRES_USER: ravenbase`), not the default `postgres/postgres`.

**Tech debt noted:**
- Integration tests require local Docker postgres and `DATABASE_URL` env override — not wired into `make test` yet. Consider adding a `make test-integration` target that sets the correct URL.
